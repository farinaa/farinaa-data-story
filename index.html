          In this final project, you will use reflections about each of your projects to develop a narrative about what you have learned about data and information. You will learn about some fundamental HTML elements and their relationships and behaviors programmed with CSS. You will also learn some basic design principles, so you can make well-informed decisions about how all of your text and media elements come together into a cohesive narrative that we have been calling your “Datastory.”
