          In this final project, you will use reflections about each of your
          projects to develop a narrative about what you have learned about
          data and information. You will learn about some fundamental HTML
          elements and their relationships and behaviors programmed with CSS.
          You will also learn some basic design principles, so you can make
          well-informed decisions about how all of your text and media elements
          come together into a cohesive narrative that we have been calling
          your “Datastory.”
