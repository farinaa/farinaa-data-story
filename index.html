          Welcome to my Data Story Project website! On this website I'll be
          talking about each of the projects that I completed for my writing
          and digital media english class. I'll be discussing what each project
          entailed, what I did to complete each project, and what I learned
          from them. I designed this website so that I have a column for each
          of my previous projects. Then I have a footer to talk about this
          website project itself. Here's what I learned from this course:

          The first project was called the data collection project. For this
          project I had to think of scenarios in which I use technology and ask
          a question about why I use that technology in the way that I do. So
          after I thought about what to collect data from, I decided to collect
          data about whenever I would use my "run-through" apps. My run-through
          apps were apps that I used in a certain order and it would always be
          the same seven apps. The apps (in order) are: Mail, Clock, App Store,
          Messages, Messenger, Instagram, and Snapchat. I realized that I would
          run through all seven of these apps everyday multiple times a day. I
          thought that I should incorporate this realization into this project
          with the question of "What apps am I using on my phone and why?" I
          wanted to put an emphasis on what I'm feeling before, during, and
          after I go through a run-through. The data points I decided to make
          were times I used the app, how long I used the app for, what I was
          doing while using the app, how I was feeling, the intensity of that
          feeling, and where I was while I was using the app. So over the
          course of five days I would record these data points into the Google
          spreadsheet. At the end of the collection, I looked at the data and
          saw that I was pretty stressed out during the collection week. What I
          learned from this project was that there is so much data in the
          world. Everybody generates data, and that data could be considered
          "small" data. In class we talked about how Facebook tries to use the
          data we generate from our online habits to make a profile about us
          that made accurate assumptions about what our interests are and what
          kind of person we are. This was an eye-opener for me and I was glad
          that this project made me realize this fact.

          The second project was called the data visualization project. For
          this project I had to take the data I collected from the previous
          project and make a visualization of the data to convey what I learned
          from that data. In order to do this we learned how to use a free
          open-source image editor called Inkscape. We also learned about the
          different ways we could display data. Things like chart types and
          attributes were ways we could accomplish this. I used a spacial chart
          type with lines around pictures to represent my feelings. Each
          picture represented a place where I did my run-through. Around each
          of those pictures were the pictures of each app. On top of those
          pictures were bars that served as a way to visualize how long I used
          the app for and what I was feeling while using the app. I also had
          arrows to indicate if the same feeling intensified or died down if
          the next app in the sequence had the same feeling from the previous
          app. The bars are designed to be read clockwise starting from the
          Mail app (which is located above every location picture). From the
          entire visual I was able to show that I would be stressed out on
          campus the most, I would do run-throughs more if I was stressed out
          and less if I was happy, and using the Messenger app would seem to
          alleviate my stress. This is because I would talk to my friends from
          back home in this app and they would usually be able to cheer me up.
          I thought that the visual was a good way to analyze the data from the
          previous project. From this project I learned about the different
          ways to represent data to tell a story. I realized that this
          visualization was a way of communicating and also served as a good
          analyzation tool to see what else the data means. I also learned
          about how to ethically represent data. I made sure that I was honest
          in my data and that I told the whole story while designing my
          visualization. I wanted to make sure that I was including as much
          relevant data as possible. I knew that I could have changed data,
          highlighted unrelated data, or made data look misleading, but I
          wanted to make sure everything was represented evenly and honestly so
          I could make that project as best as it could be. I also wanted to
          make sure that I was honest with the way I displayed my data so that
          I would be able to draw relevant conclusions from it.
