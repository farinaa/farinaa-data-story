          Welcome to my Data Story Project website! On this website I'll be
          talking about each of the projects that I completed for my writing
          and digital media english class. I'll be discussing what each project
          entailed, what I did to complete each project, and what I learned
          from them. I designed this website so that I have a column for each
          of my previous projects. Then I have a footer to talk about this
          website project itself. Here's what I learned from this course:

          The first project was called the data collection project. For this
          project I had to think of scenarios in which I use technology and ask
          a question about why I use that technology in the way that I do. So
          after I thought about what to collect data from, I decided to collect
          data about whenever I would use my "run-through" apps. My run-through
          apps were apps that I used in a certain order and it would always be
          the same seven apps. The apps (in order) are: Mail, Clock, App Store,
          Messages, Messenger, Instagram, and Snapchat. I realized that I would
          run through all seven of these apps everyday multiple times a day. I
          thought that I should incorporate this realization into this project
          with the question of "What apps am I using on my phone and why?" I
          wanted to put an emphasis on what I'm feeling before, during, and
          after I go through a run-through. The data points I decided to make
          were times I used the app, how long I used the app for, what I was
          doing while using the app, how I was feeling, the intensity of that
          feeling, and where I was while I was using the app. So over the
          course of five days I would record these data points into the Google
          spreadsheet. At the end of the collection, I looked at the data and
          saw that I was pretty stressed out during the collection week. What I
          learned from this project was that there is so much data in the
          world. Everybody generates data, and that data could be considered
          "small" data. In class we talked about how Facebook tries to use the
          data we generate from our online habits to make a profile about us
          that made accurate assumptions about what our interests are and what
          kind of person we are. This was an eye-opener for me and I was glad
          that this project made me realize this fact.

          In this final project, you will use reflections about each of your
          projects to develop a narrative about what you have learned about
          data and information. You will learn about some fundamental HTML
          elements and their relationships and behaviors programmed with CSS.
          You will also learn some basic design principles, so you can make
          well-informed decisions about how all of your text and media elements
          come together into a cohesive narrative that we have been calling
          your “Datastory.”
